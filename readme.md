#Temperature Converter

We will be using JavaScript to make a temperature conversion utility. A folder is provided for you, with empty HTML and CSS files.

##Requirements
* Create a single page using HTML/CSS that contains an `<input>` field, a `<button>` and a `<div>`.
* Convert the temperature from F to C using the formula we created earlier this week (or Google it).

###User Experience

1. User puts in a value into the text field
2. User clicks on button
3. `div` gets updated with converted value.
4. Make a clear button to reset the fields

**Bonus**

1. Have the `div` turn **blue** for freezing temperatures, **red** for scorching temperatures.

2. Use a `dropdown` or `radio` buttons to select different units to convert (Fahrenheit to Celsius, or Celsius to Fahrenheit)

3. Place the `<input>` and `<button>` elements into a form, so that pressing ENTER will automatically convert the temperature. Note that there's an event type called `'submit'` that you can use instead of `'click'`.

4. Add your own personal sense of style using CSS styling and positioning techniques. Ideas include:
  * different fonts (see [Google Fonts](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started) for how to link fonts into a webpage)
  * images
  * colors
  * borders
